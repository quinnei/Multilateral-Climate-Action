# Public attitudes toward multilateral climate action



## I. Research Question

ðŸ”¸How does <br> :one: *support for diversity* (pluralistic views of the world) and <br> :two: *current workings of democracy* affect people's confidence in multilateral efforts to tackle climate change?

ðŸ”¸Does the relationship between one's a) *socio-political views* and b) *confidence in the effectiveness of multilateral climate action* differ <ins>*across* countries</ins> in the developed world?

## II. Scope of Research

:point_right: The 6 Developed countries were selected based on 3 criteria:


ðŸ”¹**Geographical diversity** <br>
ðŸ”¹**Countries with outsized economic impact or outsized GHG emissions** - <ins>*Criteria*</ins>: Top 10 Global Polluters  <br>
ðŸ”¹**Countries at the forefront of climate action** - <ins>*Criteria*</ins>: Fossil fuel consumption, per capita

:triangular_flag_on_post: US, Germany, South Korea, Australia, Sweden, The Netherlands

## III. Hypotheses

ðŸ”¸ **$H_1$**: Those who show support for diversity within a society are more likely to be optimistic of the impacts of joint, multilateral solutions to climate change.

ðŸ”¸ **$H_2$**: Those who are satisfied with the way democracy functions in one's home country are more likely to be optimistic of collective, multilateral efforts to climate action.



## IV. Statistical Model

ðŸ”¸Logistic regression ([R script](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/quinnei/Multilateral-Climate-Action/blob/main/2_R%20code%20script/Public_attitudes_toward_multilateral_climate_action.html))


## V. Data

:open_file_folder: [<ins>Global Attitudes Survey, Spring 2021</ins>](https://github.com/quinnei/Climate-Action/blob/main/1_Data/American%20Trends%20Panel%20(Wave%2082).sav) (The Pew Research Center)
-  A global public opinion survey on peopleâ€™s assessments of their own lives and their attitudes about the current state of the world
-  Conducted across 15 advanced economies, among adults aged 18 and older
    - <ins> Oceania </ins> - Australia, New Zealand
    - <ins> North America </ins> - Canada
    - <ins> Europe </ins> - Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the UK
    - <ins> Asia </ins> - Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan


:open_file_folder: [<ins>American Trends Panel, Wave 82, February 2021</ins>](https://github.com/quinnei/Climate-Action/blob/main/1_Data/Global%20Attitudes%20Survey%20(Spring%202021).sav) (The Pew Research Center)
- A public opinion survey of the U.S. adult population (aged 18 and older)
- Measures Americans' attitudes on politics and major policy issues 


## VI. Findings

ðŸ”¸ **$H_1$** was supported, but **$H_2$** was not supported. <br> 
:writing_hand: Perceptions of the way democracy functions at home had a statistically significant effect on one's confidence in multilateral climate action, but it worked in the opposite direction to what had been hypothesized.

ðŸ”¸Overall, **the Swedes tended to exhibit low expectations** about tackling climate change through multilateralism, <br> whereas **Koreans tended to be more optimistic**, regardless of the degree of support for diversity and satisfaction with democracy.


## VII. Implications

ðŸ”¸The less satisfied an individual with the domestic functioning of democracy, the more skeptical one is of the domestic capacity to handle climate change, and thus the more they seek recourse to multilateral solutions.

ðŸ”¸Skepticism among Swedes may be explained by <br> :one: their critical view of how the world's largest economies (e.g. US and China) are handling climate change and <br> :two: the belief that international climate actions (such as the COP26) are more of an 'empty talk' and 'empty promises'.

ðŸ”¸Optimism among Koreans may be explained by the country's increased prominence in the multilateral stage on climate change issues. <br> 
:point_right: e.g. keynote speech at the COP26 and APEC summit <br>
:point_right: e.g. its pledge to reduce methane emissions and coal consumption <br>
:point_right: e.g. hosting of the World Forestry Congress <br>
:writing_hand: The rhetoric on 'collective action' and 'solidarity' throughout these events may have fueled a sense of optimism in the power of multilateral solutions.
